# Echo-generator-
Echo generator using matlab
Echo generation and Audio signal analysis

Abstract:- In this project, I am going to generate an Echo for the given audio signal with the help of the fast Fourier transform and do the audio signal analysis by generating time, mean, standard deviation, and the spectrogram of the given audio signal.

Apparatus Required:-

Matlab software
Test audio signals

Matlab:-

MATLAB is a programming software made especially for engineers around the world. The heart of MATLAB is the MATLAB language, a matrix-based language.

Using MATLAB, you can:

Analyze data
Develop algorithms
Create models and applications

The language, apps, and built-in math functions help you to quickly explore multiple ways to come to or conclude at a solution. MATLAB lets you take your ideas from research-level to production level by deploying to enterprise applications and embedded devices, as well as adding with Simulink.

What is the Echo?

A sound that is repeated after the original sound has stopped.

What is a spectrogram?

A spectrogram is a visual way of representing the signal strength(loudness), of a signal over time at different frequencies present in a particular waveform or the given signals. We can not only can one see whether there is more or less energy at a point in the signal, for example, 2 Hz vs 10 Hz, but one can also see how energy levels vary over time. In other sciences, spectrograms used to show the frequencies of sound waves produced by humans, machinery, etc., as recorded by microphones. In the seismic world, spectrograms are mostly used to look at the frequency content of continuous signals recorded by seismometers to help analyze different types of earthquakes or other vibrations in the earth.

How do you read a spectrogram?

Spectrograms are 2D graphs, with a third dimension of the graph is represented by colors. Time runs from left to right along the x-axis. The y-axis represents frequency, which can also be thought of as pitch or tone, with the lowest frequencies at the bottom and the highest frequencies at the top. The amplitude (or energy or “loudness”) of a particular frequency at a particular time is represented by the third dimension, color, with dark blues corresponding to low amplitudes and brighter colors up through red corresponding to progressively stronger (or louder) amplitudes.

Procedure:-

Create a folder for the test signals on your desktop.
Now open the Matlab and set the current location to the test signals folder.
Now run the code in the script.
